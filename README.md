# Valo Stats

## Concept
- The idea surrounding this application is being able to log your Valorant (Video Game) match history.
	- With the match history logged you can then get stats on your wins/losses and who is your best picked agent.


## Features
- Log your match info on the matches tab.
- Review your match history on the matches tab.
- Find a list of current agents in the game.
- Find a list of current maps in the game.

## Potential Updates
- Break out each route separately.
- Create a drop down for picking agent when adding to a match.
	- Had issue figuring out how to pass the select/options data to the front end.
- Add the statistics to the dasboard tab.
- Add in better error handling.
- Create the missing links between tables.
	- ERD can be found in the ERD folder.
- Make the css a lot better. Currently is just bare bones.
